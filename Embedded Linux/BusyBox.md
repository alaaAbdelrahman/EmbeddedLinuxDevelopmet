> BusyBox is a software tool that enables you to create a customized root file system for your embedded Linux products.

### Why BusyBox?

1. **Customized File System**: BusyBox allows you to create a customized file system that meets resource requirements.
2. **Resource Limitation**: When the product is resource-limited in terms of memory, BusyBox enables you to customize the file system to fit within the product's limited memory space.
3. **Removal of Unwanted Features**: You can remove all unwanted features that the product doesn't need, such as unnecessary Linux commands and features.
4. **Memory Efficiency**: BusyBox has the potential to reduce the memory consumed by various Linux commands by merging all the Linux commands into one single binary.

## Building BusyBox

BusyBox can be built in two ways:
- **Static with No Shared Libraries**
- **Dynamic with Shared Libraries**

### Build Command

```bash
make ARCH=architecture CROSS_COMPILE=compiler_name CONFIG_PREFIX="location_of_install_busybox" install


---
The default configuration generates around **89 commands in the `bin/` folder**. You can use `menuconfig` to increase or decrease these commands.
---

Adjust the placeholders like `architecture`, `compiler_name`, and `location_of_install_busybox` with the appropriate values.
